# WingShapeBSA

This is the landing page for work flow and scripts related to the WingShapeBSA project. 

All data is pool sequencing data (sequencing from MSU lab). Reads are 150 BP paired end sequencing. 

This project consits of two studies 
  1. Response to selection. Using a sythetic outbread population, lines were selected for 7 generations based on similarity to shape chage vector (either ds or emc). Pools consist of 75 individuals in each of three replicates (A,B,C) for each of the selection treatments (UP, DOWN, CONTROL) 
  2. Natural populations. Cohorts were collected from 4 populations in Michigan and phenotyped based on similarity to the focal gene (ds or neur) shape change vector. Pools are the most extreme individuals in this distribution. Pools consist of 75 individuals in each pool within each of the 4 populations. 


The goal is to idenetify the regions of the genome selected on in the first project as well as those regions/genes contributing to the pehotypic cange.
